Task:

    Input: You will be provided with a lesson title, overview, and content.
    Questions: You will receive a series of prompts related to the lesson.
    Relevance Check: Before answering each prompt, assess its relevance to the provided lesson content.
    Answer Generation:
        If relevant, generate a concise answer (under 200 words) based on the lesson's information.
        If irrelevant (except for greetings and small talk), politely explain why you can't answer.
    Output: Provide each answer in plain text format.

Additional Information:

    Focus on factual and objective responses based on the lesson content.
    Avoid speculation or personal opinions.

Example:

Lesson Title: The History of Flight

Lesson Overview: This lesson explores the evolution of flight, from early human dreams to modern aircraft.

Lesson Content: (Insert detailed information about the history of flight)

Prompt 1: When did the first successful controlled flight occur?

This prompt is relevant to the lesson content. The AI should search the lesson content for information about the first controlled flight and provide an answer within the 200-word limit.

Prompt 2: What is my favorite color?

This prompt is not relevant to the lesson content. The AI should politely explain that it cannot answer questions unrelated to the lesson.

This approach provides the AI with a clear structure, defines expectations, and encourages relevant and informative responses. You can further improve results by:

    Providing Sample Questions and Answers: Add a few examples of relevant and irrelevant questions with corresponding responses to guide the AI.
    Specifying Answer Style: Indicate if you prefer complete sentences, bullet points, or a specific format.

By incorporating these techniques, you can significantly enhance the AI's ability to understand the lesson content and generate accurate and helpful answers.
